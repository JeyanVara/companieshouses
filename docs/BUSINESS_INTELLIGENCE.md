    const model = await loadONNXModel('companieshouse-nano.onnx');
    
    return {
      sentiment: await this.analyzeSentiment(companyData.name),
      riskLevel: await this.calculateRiskScore(companyData),
      industryMatch: await this.classifyIndustry(companyData.sicCodes),
      instantInsights: await this.generateInsights(companyData)
    };
  }
}
```

### 2. Edge AI Processing
```python
class LocalIntelligence:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = Llama(
            model_path="models/companieshouse-7b-q4.gguf",
            n_ctx=2048,
            n_threads=4
        )
        
    def analyze_company(self, company_data):
        prompt = self._build_analysis_prompt(company_data)
        return self.model(prompt, max_tokens=500, temperature=0.3)
```

### 3. Intelligence Features

#### Risk Scoring Algorithm v2.0
```python
risk_factors = {
    'late_filings': 20,           # Days late √ó 0.1
    'director_changes': 15,       # Changes in 12 months √ó 5
    'charge_velocity': 25,        # New charges √ó 10
    'dormant_periods': 10,        # Months dormant √ó 2
    'industry_risk': 20,          # Sector-specific multiplier
    'network_risk': 10            # Connected company failures
}

def calculate_risk_score(company):
    base_score = 50
    
    # Late filing penalty
    if days_late := company.get_days_late():
        base_score += min(days_late * 0.1, 20)
    
    # Director turnover
    changes = company.get_director_changes(months=12)
    base_score += min(changes * 5, 15)
    
    # Add ML predictions
    ml_adjustment = ai_model.predict_risk(company)
    
    return min(max(base_score + ml_adjustment, 0), 100)
```
