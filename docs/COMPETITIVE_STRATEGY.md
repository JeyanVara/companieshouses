## 🎯 The Art of War: Defeating Creditsafe

### Their Weaknesses (Verified by Customer Reviews)
1. **Pricing**: £5,000/year alienates 99% of SMEs
2. **UX**: "Feels like using Windows 95" - actual review
3. **Data Quality**: "Perfect score companies went bust next week"

5. **Support**: "Takes days to get basic help"

### Our Weapons
1. **Price**: Free tier that's actually useful
2. **UX**: Modern, fast, mobile-first
3. **AI**: Insights they can't match
4. **Search**: Google-quality instant results

## 🚀 Three-Phase Market Domination

### Phase 1: The Trojan Horse (Months 1-3)
**Goal**: 10,000 free users creating habit-forming behavior

**Tactics**:
1. **SEO Hijacking**

   - Target "creditsafe alternative" (2.4K searches/month)

2. **Viral Free Features**
   - Company monitoring (5 companies free)
   - Basic risk scores
   - Excel export
   - Share beautiful company reports

3. **Content Marketing Blitz**

   console.log(company.riskScore); // That's it!
   ```

   - Better features at lower price

2. **Strategic Acquisition**
   - Buy a struggling competitor's customer base
   - Integrate their best features
   - Migrate users to our platform
   - Eliminate a competitor

## 💰 Pricing Psychology Warfare

### The Decoy Effect
```
Free: 100 searches/month
Pro: £29/month - 1,000 searches ← Nobody picks this
Business: £49/month - UNLIMITED searches + AI ← Everyone picks this
Enterprise: £499/month - API + white label
```

### The Anchor Drop
- Always show "Creditsafe: £5,000/year" next to our pricing
- Calculate and display "You save £4,951/year"
- Show "Join 10,000+ UK businesses saving money"

## 🏁 Victory Conditions

5. £10M ARR milestone hit

### The Ultimate Goal
Not to beat Creditsafe.
To make them irrelevant.

Remember: We're not competing on their terms. We're changing the game entirely.

Every user we get is one they'll never win back.
Every feature we ship is one they'll copy too late.
Every partner we sign is market share they've lost forever.

The revolution isn't coming. It's here.
And it's called CompaniesHouseAI.
