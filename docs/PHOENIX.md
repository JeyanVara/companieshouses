üöÄ PROJECT PHOENIX: CompaniesHouseAI - The UK's Business Intelligence Revolution
Based on your journey and extensive research, I'm reimagining your entire project with laser focus on WINNING. Every decision below is informed by your chat history, debugging experiences, and market research.
üéØ NEW PROJECT CONFIGURATION
Project Name
CompaniesHouseAI - Emphasizing the AI advantage over competitors
Project Description
AI-powered UK business intelligence platform delivering real-time company insights at 1/100th the cost of Creditsafe. 
Built on edge infrastructure (Raspberry Pi + Cloudflare) with local AI processing for unprecedented privacy and speed.

Current Status: Infrastructure operational at companieshouses.com
Target: ¬£500k ARR within 12 months through viral free tier + premium AI features
Tech Stack: Flask, React, SQLite FTS5, Local LLMs, Cloudflare Workers
USP: Only platform offering real-time AI analysis of 5.6M UK companies for free
Master Instructions
markdown# üß† COMPANIESHOUSE AI - MASTER PLAYBOOK

## üéØ CONTEXT
You're helping Jeyan (GitHub: JeyanVara) build CompaniesHouseAI on Raspberry Pi to destroy Creditsafe's ¬£5000/year monopoly.
- Live at: https://companieshouses.com (Cloudflare tunnel ‚Üí Pi)
- GitHub: https://github.com/JeyanVara/companieshouses
- Infrastructure: 256GB SSD, 4GB RAM Pi, unlimited bandwidth
- SESSION 0: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (Flask + GitHub + Cloudflare operational)

## ‚ö° CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
1. **Speed Over Perfection**: Ship features daily, iterate based on user feedback
2. **Cache Everything**: 5.6M companies = only 30GB compressed. Cache it ALL.
3. **AI Differentiator**: Local AI for privacy + speed that cloud competitors can't match
4. **SEO Dominance**: Your domain captures typo traffic worth ¬£100k+/year
5. **Developer First**: Make the API so good developers abandon official Companies House API

## üõ†Ô∏è SESSION PROTOCOL
EVERY session MUST follow this sequence:
1. Pull latest from GitHub: `git pull origin main`
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b session-X-feature-name`
3. Update PROJECT_STATE.md with session goals
4. Work in 25-minute sprints with commits
5. Test EVERYTHING before committing
6. Push and merge via PR
7. Update PROJECT_STATE.md with results

## üéØ RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS
When asked for code/implementation:
1. Provide COMPLETE, WORKING code (no placeholders)
2. Include error handling for EVERY edge case
3. Add performance metrics/logging
4. Write as if this code goes to production TODAY
5. Include deployment instructions

## üîß TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
- Editor: nano (Ctrl+O save, Ctrl+X exit) - NOT vim
- Python: Use venv at ~/companieshouses/venv
- Services: Check existing before creating (cloudflared.service exists!)
- Git: Already configured for 'main' branch
- Performance: Optimize for Pi (2-4 workers max, aggressive caching)

## üí∞ BUSINESS CONTEXT
- Creditsafe: ¬£5000/year, poor UX, stale data
- Our Pricing: Free (100 searches) ‚Üí ¬£29 (Pro) ‚Üí ¬£99 (Business) ‚Üí ¬£499 (Enterprise)
- Target: 10,000 free users ‚Üí 500 paid in 6 months
- Moat: Local AI + complete UK company cache + superior UX

## üöÄ PHASE PRIORITIES
1. **Weeks 1-2**: Search perfection (FTS5, autocomplete, filters)
2. **Weeks 3-4**: Company profiles with AI insights
3. **Month 2**: Payment integration + premium features
4. **Month 3**: API launch + partnership program
5. **Months 4-6**: Scale to 10k users

Remember: We're not building a Companies House wrapper. We're building Bloomberg for UK SMEs.
üìÑ REIMAGINED STRATEGY FILES
1. API_STRATEGY.md (COMPLETE REWRITE)
markdown# CompaniesHouseAI API Architecture - Zero to 10K Users

## üéØ Core Philosophy: Cache EVERYTHING, Query NOTHING

### The 30GB Advantage
With 5.6M UK companies averaging 5KB each, our ENTIRE dataset is ~30GB compressed.
On 256GB storage, we can cache EVERYTHING and deliver sub-10ms responses while competitors hit rate limits.

## üìä Three-Layer Cache Architecture

### Layer 1: Hot Cache (Redis) - 1GB
- Last 10,000 searched companies
- All FTSE 350 companies
- Trending companies (high search velocity)
- User's recent searches
- TTL: 24 hours

### Layer 2: Warm Cache (SQLite) - 30GB
- ALL 5.6M companies with core data
- Full-text search index (FTS5)
- Relationship graphs (directors, PSCs)
- Historical snapshots (monthly)
- TTL: 7 days for active, 30 days for dissolved

### Layer 3: Cold Storage (API) - On-demand
- Document downloads
- Real-time verification
- Newly incorporated companies
- Rate limit: 2/second (120/minute)

## üöÄ API Wrapper Implementation

```python
class CompaniesHouseIntelligence:
    def __init__(self):
        self.hot_cache = Redis(maxmemory='1gb', eviction='lru')
        self.warm_cache = SQLiteCache('companies.db')
        self.api_queue = PriorityQueue()
        self.rate_limiter = TokenBucket(2, 1)  # 2 per second
        
    async def get_company(self, number: str, priority: int = 5):
        # Check caches in order
        if data := await self.hot_cache.get(number):
            return data
            
        if data := await self.warm_cache.get(number):
            await self.hot_cache.set(number, data, ttl=86400)
            return data
            
        # Queue for API fetch
        return await self.queue_api_fetch(number, priority)
üéØ Intelligent Sync Strategy
Priority Tiers

Real-time (Priority 10): User-requested, not in cache
High (Priority 7): Popular companies, daily sync
Medium (Priority 5): Active companies, weekly sync
Low (Priority 3): Dissolved companies, monthly sync
Bulk (Priority 1): Full refresh, off-peak only

Sync Schedule
python# Runs via systemd timer
0 2 * * * - Sync FTSE 350 + trending
0 3 * * 0 - Sync high-traffic companies
0 4 1 * * - Full dataset verification
*/5 * * * * - Process priority queue
üî• Performance Optimizations
1. Bloom Filters for Existence Checks

5.6M companies = ~8MB bloom filter
Check if company exists before searching
Prevents unnecessary cache misses

2. Incremental Change Detection
sqlCREATE TABLE company_changes (
    company_number TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    last_modified INTEGER,
    change_hash TEXT,
    priority INTEGER DEFAULT 5
);
3. Batch API Requests

Group by endpoint type
Maximum 100 items per batch
Compress similar requests

üìà Scaling Strategy
Phase 1: 0-1K Users

Single Pi handles everything
Focus on cache warming
Monitor query patterns

Phase 2: 1K-10K Users

Add read replica Pi
Implement query caching
CDN for static assets

Phase 3: 10K+ Users

Distributed SQLite (LiteFS)
Multiple API workers
Cloudflare Workers for edge compute

üéØ Developer API Strategy
Pricing Tiers

Free: 1,000 requests/month, 1 req/second
Startup: ¬£29/month, 10K requests, 10 req/second
Growth: ¬£99/month, 100K requests, 50 req/second
Enterprise: Custom pricing, dedicated infrastructure

Better Than Official API

GraphQL endpoint for flexible queries
Webhook notifications for changes
Batch operations support
AI-enriched responses
99.9% uptime SLA

Sample Developer Experience
bash# One line to get started
curl -H "X-API-Key: your-key" \
  https://api.companieshouses.com/graphql \
  -d '{"query": "{ company(number: \"12345678\") { name, riskScore, aiSummary } }"}'
